Contexts
    * Scalar Context - Understood as single object
    * List Context - Understood as multiple objects
    * Boolean Context - Understood as true or false
        - Interprets scalars as true or false
        - Interprets lists as scalars as in
        # while (@files)
        # {
        #   my $file = shift @files;
        #   etc
        # }
    * Void Context - Not really understood as returning a value
    *  - for nonfunctional functions / functions that only have side-effects
    *
    *
    * Interpolative Context - Context inside double quotes that Interprets \n and such
 

0 but true and 0E0 are both numerically 0 but as strings they are true

qw/bob bill tim/ will make a list = ("bob", "bill", "tim")

use Modern::Perl; "Imports the basic necessities of PERL....?"
use Data::Dumper; "Gives us a way to access the contents of empty arrays."

say Dumper \@someArray; (??)

until is the opposite of while - performs until true versus while which performs until false

grep {block} @array;
    grep requires $_
    returns array of items in array that were true for the block

grep { length($_) > 4 } @someArrayOString

sort {block} @array;
    $a and b;

map {block} @array;
    map returns the value of the block for the item in the array

map and grep and such are shortcuts

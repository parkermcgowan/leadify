bigint for large numbers


Recieve user-submitted value
remove newline from user-submitted value

initialize the array to hold the primefactors

early return type of thing if number is prime
with palindrometest for greg






code to actually run the primefactors function




definition of isplaindrome function

get number as argument

return true if string number equals it's reverse

otherwise return false


definition of isprime function
  sets number variable to the argument
  initializes the count as 2

  early return for edgecase of 2

  work while the count is less than or equal to the sqrt of the number

    if number is not divisible by count

    increment count

    if the number is divisble by count

    return false - not prime


  if it goes through that loop without returning false, return true - it is prime


Function definition of primefactor
  set count to the second argument
  set number to the first argument

  if the number is prime

  add the number to the list of primefactos
  and print the list because if the number is prime the list is finished

  if the number is not prime

  check if the number is divisible by the count

  if so push the count onto the list of primefactors
  and then recursively call primefactor with the number now being the number divided by the count, and the count staying the same

  if the number is not divisble by the count

  call primefactor again with the same number but an incremented count.
